# PlotBot

PlotBot is a simple tool to parse and summarize .tlog files. Often, a telemetry file is all that remains after a lost drone. PlotBot aims to quickly provide a flight summary to help identify flight performance without needing log directly from an autopilot. 

PlotBot was built using ReactJS and styled with styled-components. Data is parsed and organized using a flask backend [here](https://github.com/louisrm/plot-bot-server).

## Getting Started

1) `npm install` to install required modules
2) `npm start` to run the app in development mode
PlotBot will run on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
